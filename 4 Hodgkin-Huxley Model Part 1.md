## Recap

Action potential is created by sodium and potassium channels opening and changing the equilibrium potential $V_\infin$

Currents for various components can be written down using a variation of Ohm's Law:

$$I_{Na}=G_{Na}(V,t)(V-E_{Na})$$

$$I_{K}=G_{K}(V,t)(V-E_{K})$$

$$I_{L}=G_{L}(V,t)(V-E_{L})$$

$$I_{m}(t)+C\frac{dv}{dt}=I_e(t)$$

Conductance is dependent on voltage, current is dependent on conductance, voltage is dependent on current etc.

Write down an algorithm

<b>Voltage and Time Dependence</b>

Voltage and time-dependent ion channel conductances are 'knobs' that control membrane potential

Measuring conductance requires keeping the voltage constant

$$G=\frac{I}{V}$$

Modifying the voltage causes the neuron to spike!

<b>Voltage Clamp</b>

Device that uses feedback to keep the cell's current stable at a desired set voltage

Op-Amp: sets output equal to the difference in input voltages times a multiplier (gain) which is very big

$$V_{out}=G(V_+-V_-)$$

Too much voltage causes a decrease in current etc.

<b>HH Experiment</b>

Did experiment with sotium and without sodium.

Sodium caused an initial negative current, which did not occur with potassium

The dependence of K and Na currents on time can now be measured using command voltage

<b>Extracting Conductance</b>

$$I_K(V)=G_K(V)(V-E_K)$$

$$G_K(V)\equiv\frac{I_K(V)}{(V-E_K)}$$

Conductance can be determined graphically, since current is zero initially and constant later (increase in both I and V is linear)

<b>Sigmoidal Voltage Dependence</b>

Both activation functions follow a sigmoidal profile

<b>Time Dependence</b>

$$I_K(t)=G_K(t)(V-E_K)$$

$$I_{Na}(t)=G_{Na}(t)(V-E_{Na})$$

Potassium follows a sigmoidal function while sodium has an activation and inactivation period

Action potential is generated by a pulse of sodium followed by potassium turning on
